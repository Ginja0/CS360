**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

There was the need for a login screen. The client needed to make an app with a data base and a scroll view that would hold the items. On each line there was a need for a button to delete the inventory. Making the buttons and focus on the user when making the design was key. I was thinking what would make it so that the user does not need to have a tuturial to use the the app. That everything should be self-explanitory. 

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

To test the code I ran it in the simulator. Although preferably I would of wanted to run it on my own device but the simulator helped me udnerstand that the UI and the code was working. I tested adding objects. I challange I had was trying to make the list with scrolling view. To overcome it I looked at the course matarials and the videos to get passed the problems. The best component of the app that I made was the login portion. It was well designed.
